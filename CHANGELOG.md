## Unreleased

- TLS certificate verification is now enabled by default for new configuration entries. Controllers with a self-signed certificate are supported by confirming the certificate's SHA-256 fingerprint during setup. Existing entries keep their current setting; a repair notice explains how to switch verification on. Verification can be turned off per entry under Configure.
